# NMT Testing

Translation errors found by our approach in [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) and [Bing Microsoft Translator](https://www.bing.com/translator). 

we introduce a novel methodology called PatInv for validating machine translation software. The main intuition behind PatInv is that sentences with different meanings should not have the same translations. Hence, we find pair of sentences with different meanings but same translations. PatInv is able to find many translation errors in on two language settings (Eng->Hindi and Eng->Chinese). We will keep updating the erroneous translations uncovered by PatInv to this repo. A pathological invariant is a pair of sentences that are of different meanings but obtain the same translation. We use "pathological invariant" and "erroneous issue" interchangeably in the paper.


### Template in the translation error examples: :telescope: 
+ Row 1: source sentence (in English)
+ Row 2: new generated sentence (in English)
+ Row 3: Their same translation(in either Hindi or Chinese)
+ Row 4: Which sentence has translation error (either of first, second or both)
+ Row 5: Meaning of their common translation in english.

### Input and output example
The input of PatInv is a list of unlabeled sentences in source language. For clarity, we use an unlabeled sentence here as an example.

||
| :------------- | 
| They are doing something completely different. | 
||

The output of PatInv is a list of issues.

An example output of PatInv for English->Hindi language setting is as follows. 

| Issue 1 |
| :------------- | 
| They are doing something completely different. |
| They are doing something slightly different. | 
| वे कुछ अलग कर रहे हैं। |
| both |
| They are doing something different. | 

| Issue 2 |
| :------------- | 
| They are doing something completely different. |
| They are doing something different. | 
| वे कुछ अलग कर रहे हैं। |
| first |
| They are doing something slightly different. | 

As we can see, PatInv reports two suspicious issues. These two issues are genearated using two different approaches. Issue 1 is generated by perturbing a word in a sentence, whereas issue 2 is generated by removing word/phrase from a sentence.
